Hello my name is John! I love programming and I have for a long time. Currently, I am a highschool senior who is about to pursue cybersecurity as a career path, and as such I have decided to run a blog detailing all the fun discoveries I make along the way!

Feel free to check out some of my public projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnSwiftC/), especially GuShell, my most recent repo! Outside of GitHub, I have an app on the iOS app store! Search 'Prodi - Focus Tracker' to find it!

Business part aside, I do have two dogs, Jake and Marco, whom I both love dearly (*Marco a little less*) üêï. Wrestling team captain and student away from programming, and middle child stuck between 3 sisters and a brother. Macarons (**NOT MACAROONS**) are my favorite dessert, please buy me some.
