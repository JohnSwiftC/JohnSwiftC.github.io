Hello my name is John! I love programming and channel that into open-source cybersecurity tools and project! When I'm not developing, I track down vulnerabilites in companies for fun and sometimes a bounty. 

> Everything I have done and will do is legal. It is possible to use several of my projects illegally and I am not responsible for those people. I program and run this blog for fun.

Feel free to check out some of my public projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnSwiftC/), I make a lot of cybersecurity focused tools and projects along with some other fun ones.

I do have two dogs, Jake and Marco, whom I both love dearly (*Marco a little less*) üêï. Wrestling team captain and student away from this, and middle child stuck between 3 sisters and a brother. Macarons are my favorite dessert, please buy me some.
