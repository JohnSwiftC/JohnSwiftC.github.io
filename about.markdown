Hello my name is John! I love programming and making things that could be illegal. Besides programming, I track down vulnerabilites in companies for fun and sometimes bounty.

> Everything I have done and will do is legal. It is possible to use several of my projects illegally and I am not responsible for those people. I program and run this blog for fun.

Feel free to check out some of my public projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/JohnSwiftC/), I make a lot of cybersecurity focused tools and projects along with some other fun ones.

Business part aside, I do have two dogs, Jake and Marco, whom I both love dearly (*Marco a little less*) üêï. Wrestling team captain and student away from programming, and middle child stuck between 3 sisters and a brother. Macarons are my favorite dessert, please buy me some.
